# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project applies multiple machine learning models to a dataset to predict a target variable. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Files

- `22103183.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the classification models.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🔢 Models Implemented

The following machine learning models were used for classification:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Model performance is also compared visually using a bar chart of accuracies.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries if they are not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Place dataset.csv and 22103183.ipynb in the same directory.

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook 22103183.ipynb
Run all cells to view data preprocessing steps, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

📌 Notes
Categorical features in the dataset are encoded using label encoding.

Data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

The final visualization helps identify the most accurate model among the four.
